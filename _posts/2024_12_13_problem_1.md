### 1. The Sock Drawer
A drawer contains red socks and black socks. When two socks are drawn at random, the probability that both are red is $\frac{1}{2}$.

(a) How small can the number of socks in the drawer be?
(b) How small if the number of black socks is even?
#### Solution:

(a)
Let $r\in\mathbb{N}$ be the number of red socks,  $b\in\mathbb{N}$ the number of black socks in the drawer, and $n=r+b$ the total number of socks in the drawer.
Then the probability that the two drawn socks are both red is $\frac{r(r-1)}{n(n-1)}$.

Thus for (a) we need to find the smallest $n$ such that there is an $r<n$ with  $\frac{r(r-1)}{n(n-1)}=\frac{1}{2}$.

Note that we need to have $1<r<n$ for this equation to possibly be fulfilled and thus $2<n$.

For $n=3$ , we need to have  $r=2$ red socks and thus $\frac{r(r-1)}{n(n-1)}=\frac{1}{3}$.  

For $n=4$ and $r=3$ we have a solution: $\frac{r(r-1)}{n(n-1)}=\frac{3\cdot 2}{4 \cdot 3}=\frac{1}{2}$ 

Thus $n=4$ is the smallest number of socks.
$\Box$

(b)
We need to find the smallest $n$ such that there is an $r$ with $n-r$ even so that 
$\frac{r(r-1)}{n(n-1)}=\frac{1}{2}$.

The following python script can be used to find all pairs $(n,r$) with $1<=n<100$ that fulfill $\frac{r(r-1)}{n(n-1)}=\frac{1}{2}$ via brute force.
```Python
for n in range(1,100):
	for r in range(2,n):
	   if r*(r-1)==(n*(n-1))/2:
		print(f"{n=} {r=}")
```

There are only two such pairs.
For $n=21$, $r=15$, $n-r=6$ is even, so the answer is $n=21$.
