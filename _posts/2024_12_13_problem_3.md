### 3. The Flippant Juror
Consider two types of juries:

1. **Three-Person Jury**: This jury consists of three members:
    - Two members each have an independent probability $p$ of making the correct decision.
    - The third member is "flippant" and makes decisions by flipping a fair coin (i.e., a 50% chance of being correct or incorrect for each decision).
    - The jury's final decision is determined by a majority vote.
2. **One-Person Jury**: This jury has a single member who has a probability $p$ of making the correct decision.
3. 
**Question**: Between the three-person jury and the one-person jury, which has a higher probability of reaching the correct decision?

Probability of 3-person jury making the correct decision:
Once again we have P(110)+P(011)+P(111)
with
$P(110) = p\cdot p$
$P(011)=\frac{1}{2}p$
$P(111)=\frac{1}{2}\cdot p\cdot p$

$P(110)+P(011)+P(111)=p^2+\frac{1}{2}p+\frac{1}{2}p^2$
$=p(\frac{3}{2}p+\frac{1}{2})$
